It's meaningless, of course, but I can absolutely picture myself saying it to a student, admitting that I'd missed something and should raise a grade.

What's actually at work here, generating the illusion of meaning? My initial thought is that the reader&mdash;me, of course, in this case&mdash;is predisposed to approach the text (*any* text? probably not) assuming that there was a good-faith effort to create meaning and that this assumption causes the reader to engage in hermeneutic processes: a series of "what if it means ...?" questions are triggered that propose reading models that might become productive interpretive pathways.
