<p>Now, connecting different ideas isn't difficult, you can connect cheese with motorcycles or moral courage with light green, or bananas with international cooperation. You can get any computer to make a billion random connection for you, but these new connections or juxtapositions are significant <i>only</i> if they generate new <i>meaning</i>.

This is of course what my automated text blogs do: generate connections at random, rapidly. The open question that makes this an interesting set of projects for me, though, is how much meaning the reader imbues the texts with.
