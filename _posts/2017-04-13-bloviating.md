<blockquote><p>Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow prevented my inbox from filling up. A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round. Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out for ourselves what to avoid and how. The hard part about figuring out what youâ€™re building, and it was a good time to start a startup? How important it is for the company to have a cup of tea. A rounds, but these are likely to make the company his full-time. Facebook sounded to me when I had no idea what to do.</p>

This works well as plausible text *precisely because* the loose-associative nature of Graham's text shows that he often does tiptoe lightly through the topics, moving on as new inspiration strikes. This is a surprisingly good automated parody of this particular process for this reason, but also because it manages to get the (perceived) tone of patronising advice right, too.
